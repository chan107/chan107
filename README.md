     The song is Summer by Brockhampton. I really love this song because I’m a big fan of the electric guitar sound.

>>> 
This project involved creating my own makeup filters, space distortion filters, art filters, game filters, etc., using the features provided by Effect House. It was a competition where I could freely create filters without any limitations on the number of creations for a certain period, and awards were given to the team with the highest views.

I finished the competition in 3rd place.

  Personal Development Goals ✌🏻
</h2>
<h3>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8bsJsGXYq0">
  1) The kind of drama I consider good is one that draws the viewers into a state of complete immersion. To achieve this, the creator must never plan any scene carelessly and should be able to connect all the scenes like a spiderweb. As someone who dreams of becoming a drama director, I hope to develop these skills and become a great director in the future. 🎬

 2) I am also very interested in music, and although I am still inexperienced, I have been studying composition little by little. Due to some practical challenges, it was difficult to focus on music this year, but next year, I want to challenge my dreams with friends who share the same passion for music.
